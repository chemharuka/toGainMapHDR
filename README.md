# Convert HDR files to Gain Map HDR

A macOS tool for converting HDR files to Adaptive (Gain Map) HDR / ISO HDR.

Include:

1. toGainMapHDR, which convert png, tiff etc. HDR file to Adaptive HDR (gain map heic file) / ISO HDR (PQ or HLG curve image). The program will read a image as both SDR and HDR image, then calculate difference between two images as gain map.
2. heic_hdr.py, a ChatGPT generated python script to convert all TIFF file to HEIC.
3. HDRmaxKernel.ci.metallib, library needed to get headroom of HDR image.
4. GainMapKernel.ci.metallib, library needed to output Apple gain map.

## Usage

### toGainMapHDR

Convert any HDR Files to Gain_Map_HDR.heic by toGainMapHDR:

`./toGainMapHDR $file_dir $folder_dir $options`

Supported input format: 

* AVIF、JXL、HEIF (in PQ/HLG/Gain map)
* TIFF (in PQ/HLG/Linear32)
* PNG (in PQ/HLG)
* JPG (gain map)
* EXR、HDR

(Note: Some formats have width/height limitation, only support the image file which could be openned by preview app)

#### System Require

Require macOS 15.0+ (Some format support require 15.1+).

PLEASE UPGRADE your system to LATEST version for more compatibility.

PLEASE UPGRADE your system to LATEST version for more compatibility.

#### Options:

-q \<value>: image quality (default: 0.85)

-b \<file_path>: specify the base image and output in RGB gain map format.

-t \<text>: add extra text after the output file name.

-c \<color space>: output color space (srgb, p3, rec2020), default use source file's color space.

-d \<color depth>: output color depth (default: 8)

-g: output Apple gain map HDR \*\*

-s: export tone mapped SDR image without HDR gain map

-j: export image in JPEG format

-p: export 10-bit PQ HDR heic image

-h: export HLG HDR heic image (default in 10-bit)

-help: print help information

#### Sample command：

 `./toGainMapHDR ~/Downloads/abc.png ~/Documents/ -q 0.95 -d 10 -c rec2020`

 `./toGainMapHDR ~/Downloads/abc.tiff ~/Documents/ -q 0.80 -j`
 
convert gain map abc.avif to gain map heic file and keep base image:
 
 `./toGainMapHDR ~/Downloads/abc.avif ~/Documents/ -b ./Downloads/abc.avif` 
 
convert abc.tiff to Apple gain map HDR file:
 
 `./toGainMapHDR ~/Downloads/abc.tiff ~/Documents/ -g` 
 
convert abc.tiff to HLG HDR file:
 
 `./toGainMapHDR ~/Downloads/abc.tiff ~/Documents/ -h` 
 
convert RGB gain map (adaptive HDR) file to monochrome gain map (Apple HDR) heic file:

 `./toGainMapHDR ~/Downloads/abc.heic ~/Downloads/ -g -t -mono` 

#### Note: 

1. Using a specific base photo will result larger file size (approximately double)
2. Exporting 10-bit heic files will result larger file size (approximately double)
3. \*\* Monochrome gain map compatible with Google Photos (Android version), Instagram etc. Recommended to use for sharing.
4. When exporting 8-bit heic photo, color discontinuity may occur in low-texture areas, like clouds, lakes.
5. Starting from a certain version of macOS, built-in function generate real RGB gain maps, not recommended to use the -b parameter.

### heic_hdr.py

Batch convert all tiff files in a folder by heic_hdr.py:

1. Download all files in a folder:

`git clone https://github.com/chemharuka/toGainMapHDR.git`

`cd toGainMapHDR/bin`

`chmod 711 ./toGainMapHDR`

2. run heic_hdr.py (default run with 8 threads, change it accroding to your chip's performance core.)

`python3 ./heic_hdr.py $folder_for_convert $options`

You may need to change the DIR of toGainMapHDR in heic_hdr.py before running. (in line 44)

#### Sample：

`python3 ./heic_hdr.py ~/Documents/export/ -q 0.90 -c rec2020 -g`

#### Note: 

1. Not support specifying base image in batch converting.

## Known Issue

HDR decoding path mis-handle when large AVIF image (long edge ≥ 8192) as input on Intel Mac. This is a problem with the system's built-in function and may be fixed in a future system version.

When using an Apple Gain Map HDR image as input, output image brightness is incorrect. This is a problem with the system's built-in function and may be fixed in a future system version.

Starting from macOS 15.2, it seems that Apple has limited the maximum display headroom of HDR (in HLG, PQ, and ISO Gain Map) to 4.926, and the part above this brightness will be hard-clipping (Not feature, just bug, I guess). The HLG image WILL LOSE THIS PART OF THE DATA. Apple Gain Map is not subject to this limitation.

Apple add new CIImageRepresentationOption 'hdrGainMapAsRGB' to generate RGB gain map, but not avalible on macOS 15.5. Not recommand to usb -b parameter.

FIXED: ~~It's better to limit PQ HDR range in +2 eV, to avoid losing hightlight details.~~

FIXED: ~~HDR headroom was limited to +2 eV, might improve in future.~~

FIXED: ~~Not support HDR preview in Google Photos.~~
